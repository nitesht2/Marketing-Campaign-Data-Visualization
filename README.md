# Creating Customer Persona for Marketing Campaign

This data analysis is for non profit organisation whose marketing department wants to find out the customer that the company would want to target for their environmental initiative marketing campaign. Data can be found [here](https://github.com/nitesht2/Marketing-Data-Visualization/blob/main/Buyer%2BPersona%2BCase%2BStudy.csv).
First, I will create a customer demographic’s dashboard that marketing managers can leverage to uncover insights using the data quickly. This will also help to drill down within a specific category and allow the marketing manager to see where these people live and what age group they belong to. After that, we can put together a Facebook ad campaign that targets a specific area and a specific age group.

In the second part, I will perform an ad hoc analysis to deep dive into one specific question: 

- Who should we target for the environmental initiative promotional campaign?
