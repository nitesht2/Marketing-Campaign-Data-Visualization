# Marketing Data Analysis

# Introduction
This data analysis is for non profit organisation whose marketing department wants to find out the customer that the company would want to target for their environmental initiative marketing campaign. 

Data can be found [here](https://github.com/nitesht2/Marketing-Data-Visualization/blob/main/Buyer%2BPersona%2BCase%2BStudy.csv).

# Business Task:
First, create a customer demographicâ€™s dashboard that marketing manager can leverage to uncover insights using the data quickly. This will used for reporting and also help to drill down within a specific category. The marketing manager will be able to see where these people live and what age group they belong to. After that, decission will be made for a Facebook ad campaign that targets a specific area and a specific age group.

Second, Marketing manager wants me to analyze survey data of the company where they are going to send out two campaigns. One is for general awareness which will be send to all of their customers to just let them know that the company cares about the environment and they are doing some task about that. The second campaign will be for the targeted cusotmers where the company will state what they are doing and show how they can get involved. I am assigned to perform ad hoc analysis to find out:

- Who should we target for the environmental initiative promotional campaign?

# Finding:
In the adhoc analysis dashboard, first the barchar is plotted for different age group to see overall customer profile and then gender is stacked on the bar chart to see who isinfluenting the most. Since the top three age group has highest number of female so I made a group of these age group and left rest of the age category. Upon plotting the barchart using these group it shows that the group contributes 45% which validates the idea that, it is good to target 18 to 45 years old females. Also, I have also added different states to be more specific that shows the number of each age group of femal that needs to be targeted based on the states they live.
