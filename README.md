# Creating Customer Persona for Marketing Campaign

This data analysis is to determine the customer that the company would want to target for their marketing campaign. Data can be found [here]().
First, I will create a customer demographic’s dashboard that marketing managers can leverage to uncover insights using the data quickly. This will also help to drill down within a specific category and allow the marketing manager to see where these people live and what age group they belong to. After that, we can put together a Facebook ad campaign that targets a specific area and a specific age group.
In the second part, I will perform an ad hoc analysis to deep dive into one specific question: Who should we target for the environmental initiative promotional campaign?
